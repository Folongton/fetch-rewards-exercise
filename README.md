### 1. New Structured Relational Data Model
Using a diagram from DBeaver. I have decided to move out "items" Table. "items" table corresponds to the "rewardsReceiptItemList" attribute from our receipts.json file. Primary Keys are shown in Bold. I could have also simply flatten the whole receipts.json to a single table, but decided to keep it cleaner with Junction table.
